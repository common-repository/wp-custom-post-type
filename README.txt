== Description ==

WP Custom Post Type helps you kick start your WP website. It creates all the basic post types like Slider, Portfolio, Testimonial, Team, Client, Callouts. The plugin also provides shortcodes for all the post types so you can use it on any page and using any page builder to show your custom posts. 
The plugin also creates a basic single and archive page for each post type except for slider, so it doesn't break even if your theme doesn't support the plugin by default.
